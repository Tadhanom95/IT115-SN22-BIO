      Hello, my name is Tadesse Adhanom. I am currently a dedicated student learning application development . Before joining the year up program I worked as security officer in facebook company for almost 2 years .My goal is to acquire my certifications to become a software developer and to be certified program coder with a tech company or individually. Along side learning year up, I play soccer twice a week and I like to watch movies. If you have LinkedIn we can add each other and maybe we can hangout sometimes to chat or discuss in the future?
